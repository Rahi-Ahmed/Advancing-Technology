		<h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
		<p>
			The official definition of artificial intelligence (Al) is the theory and development of computer
			systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Today, there are many
			intelligent machines that work and act like humans.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you use voice assistance, such as Siri or Alexa, you are using one form of Al. Self-driving cars are
			another example of Al. Al is based on algorithms that have programmed responses based on user
			interaction. Some forms of Al allow it to improve its algorithms, and, in essence, get smarter.

			According to an article in smithsonian.com, Al is not one but hundreds of specialized tasks. Al
			algorithms are used within the stock market. Its algorithms make new algorithms that have surprised
		</p>
		<p>According to the article, Al is really taking off and is expected to replace millions of jobs, from
		   insurance to transportation, and the medical field. Robots are expected to help care for the elderly.
		</p>
		
		<p>Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Stephen Hawking have all warned about the continued development of Al.
		   Collectively, they felt that continued Al development, done improperly, could spell disaster for the
		   human race.
